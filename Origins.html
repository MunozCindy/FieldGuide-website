                    <h2>The Spanish Arrive</h2>
                    <p>To trace back the delicious Pan Dulce, we need to go back hundreds of years after the Spanish first colonized Mexico. 
                       During the time of colonization, the Spanish brought over their architecture, language, religion, and of course, its cuisine.
                       It was during that time that the Spanish oficially introduced wheat.However, while grain was a necessity to the Spanish, indigenous tribes cared little for the new crop and found spanish bread bland, dense and dry.</p>

                    <h2>The French Influence</h2>
                    <p>It was not until the end of 1812, the Viceroyalty of New Spain, that the desire for something more delicious was fulfilled with the arrival of France and its passion for bread making.  
                       The variety of French Bread or "Pan franc√©s," its cripsiness, lightness and sweetness appealed to the mexican population that it was soon adopted and improved upon by native bakers.   
                       A mixture of french technique and indigenious ingredients thus created the Pan Dulce we love today!</p>
