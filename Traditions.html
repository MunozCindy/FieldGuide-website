                  <h2>Tradition & Religion</h2>
                    <p>With the invention of pan dulce in Mexico, other culturally significant sweat bread was created to celebrate occasions and traditions, such as pan de muerto, buñuelos and rosca de reyes. 
                       These particular kinds of sweat bread are part of the traditional customs that have been around for many centuries.

                    <img class="traditionsPanImage1"src="PandeMuerto.png" alt="background" width= 60%>
                      <p>Pan de Muerto or Bread of the Dead is placed as an offering on gravesites or homemade altars during The Day of the Dead from October 31st - November 2nd. 
                          Its circular shape represents the circle of life and death and its crossed center represents the cardinal points honoring the Aztec gods.
                          It is believed that when the spirit returns during the Day of the Dead, it can be nourished by the “essence” of the bread and any other offerings that have been left for it.
                      </p>
                    <h3>Rosca de Reyes</h3>
                      <img class="traditionsPanImage2"src="RoscadeReyes.png" alt="background" width= 55%>
                        <p>The Rosca de Reyes or Kings Cake is enjoyed on January 6, Dia de los Reyes also known as "Ephinany" in honor of the Three Wise Men.  
                           They are oval in shape to symbolize a crown and are adorned with dried and candied fruits to symbolize the crown’s jewels. 
                           A small doll is hidden inside to represent baby jesus hiding from King Herod's troops. Tradition has it that whoever cuts themselves
                           a slice to discover it contains the hidden baby jesus, must host the next year's "posada" or christmas party at their house!
